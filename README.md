#MCUFRIEND_kbv

fdufnews 2/2018
Library delivered with OPENSMART TFT screen. It seems to be a copy (with some modification) of an old version of MCUFRIEND library.
It is not the up-to-date MCUFRIEND library as the screen doesn't work with the current MCUFRIEND one.


I have added support for the ILI9326 with the ATmega1284p for my own use

The screen interfaces on Port B and PortC

--------|------------------------------|----------

ILI9326 | DB8 DB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 DB3 DB2 | DB1 DB0

ATmega1284p | PC8 PC7 PC6 PC5 PC4 PC3 PC2 | PB1 PB0

It will slow down pixel transfert a little but will free IÂ²C interface wich is located on PortC D1 and D0
