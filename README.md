#MCUFRIEND_kbv

fdufnews 2/2018
Library delivered with OPENSMART TFT screen
Not the MCUFRIEND up-to-date library (it doesn't work with the current MCUFRIEND one)
I have added support for the ILI9326 with the ATmega1284p for my own use

Library for Uno 2.4, 2.8, 3.5, 3.6, 3.95 inch mcufriend  Shields

1. Install "Adafruit_GFX.h" library from GitHub into your User libraries folder if not already there.

2. Unzip the attached "MCUFRIEND_kbv.zip" into your User libraries folder.

3. Insert your Mcufriend style display shield into UNO.   Only 28-pin shields are supported.

4. Start your Arduino IDE.

5. Build any of the Examples from the File->Examples->Mcufriend_kbv menu.  e.g.

graphictest_kbv.ino: shows all the methods.

LCD_ID_readreg.ino:  diagnostic check to identify unsupported controllers.
