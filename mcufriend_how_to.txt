1. Install "Adafruit_GFX.h" library from GitHub into your User libraries folder if not already there.

2. Unzip the attached "MCUFRIEND_kbv.zip" into your User libraries folder.

3. Insert your Mcufriend style display shield into UNO.   Only 28-pin shields are supported.

4. Start your Arduino IDE.

5. Build any of the Examples from the File->Examples->Mcufriend_kbv menu.
Most of them will write some text to the Serial window (9600 baud).   The BMP examples require you to copy the pictures from the bitmaps/ folder to your microSD (root directory)

6. This library is only intended for UNO and these specific Shields.   It will work on a MEGA2560 but not very fast.

7. The constructor takes no arguments (because it only works with these shields)

8. The examples are the standard Adafruit ones.   You can see my edits by searching for "kbv"

9. Any Adafruit sketch should work with the MCUFRIEND_kbv constructor() but should allow extra ID values
An Adafruit constructor(cs, rs, wr, rd, rst) IGNORES any arguments.   i.e. it only uses the shield control pins

10. It currently supports UNO shields with "mcufriend.com" pcbs with controllers:

11. It should run on a UNO, MEGA2560, LEONARDO, DUE, ZERO and M0-PRO.

12. These Mcufriend-style shields tend to have a resistive TouchScreen on A1, 7, A2, 6 but are not always the same rotation of direction.
Run the TouchScreen_Calibr_kbv.ino sketch to diagnose your model and then scale the result from TouchScreen.h methods()
The Resistive TouchScreen does not work on the Due.   It seems to be upset by sharing pins.  I have discovered why.   
(You need a new Touch library.)

13. The aspect_kbv.ino sketch should show the 4 different rotations.   Please report the results for an ILI9335, ILI9327. 

14. The scroll_kbv.ino sketch should scroll a window or subwindow for most chips.   Not all chips can scroll.

15. The readpixel_kbv.ino sketch should display memory in each aspect. 

16. The GLUE_Demo_320x240.ino sketch uses a "GLUE" class to display a UTFT sketch on supported mcufriend shields.   
    It is NOT perfect.   Please report any problems.    It is designed as a CONVENIENCE for legacy UTFT code.   
    Please use MCUFRIEND_kbv method()s in new code.
